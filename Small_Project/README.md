# Small Project template

Template made to do small projects

## Organisation of the project files 
- just let the .c source files at the root
- just let the .h header files at the root
- modify the Makefile to adapt it to your project

## The Makefile
- modify the name of the output
- modify the name of the project for displaying
- list every .c source file into SRCS
- you can modify the compilation flags with FLAGS
> **all** rule make the project </br>
> **clean** rule clean every object files of the project </br>
> **fclean** rule clean then clean the output file </br>
> **re** rule clean and remake the project </br>

> **@** at the beginning of every line is to tell the makefile not to display commands because we do clean displaying with printf

If you have any question or improvement ideas don't hesitate to ask me here or at my discord **Foxan#0001** </br>
